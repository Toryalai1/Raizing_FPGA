## Development

This core uses JTFrame, however, I have only utilized the template of JTFrame as I do not use linux. I added some stuff to it, but fairly minimal.
Upgrading for the most part is a matter of dropping in the latest release in modules.

To compile the cores, I have included separate qsf files for each core. There are a total of 3 cores entitled bakraid, batrider and garegga.

The garegga core will play Sorcer Striker & Kingdom Grandprix as well.

It is a matter of loading up the project in quartus, and synthesizing/ building to get the rbf which you can put on your sd card for MiSTer.

Note:
- the JT9346 I have in Bakraid is not compatible with 93C66 chips, I made some changes to make it compatible.
- the YMZ280b module comes from Nullobject, I have isolated and generated the module as standalone in scala, which emits verilog. No changes.
